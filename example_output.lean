-- Part 1: Basic observations and initial setup
-- We start with some basic observations. First note that the sequence a₁, a₂, ..., a₂₀₂₃ is increasing
-- and thus, since all elements are integers, a_{n+1} - a_n ≥ 1. We also observe that a₁ = 1

theorem basic_observations (x : ℕ → ℝ) (h_pos : ∀ n, x n > 0) (h_distinct : ∀ i j, i ≠ j → x i ≠ x j) :
  let a := fun n => Real.sqrt ((∑ i in Finset.range n, x i) * (∑ i in Finset.range n, (1 / x i)))
  ∀ n, a (n + 1) ≥ a n + 1 := by
  intro n
  -- This would contain the proof that a_{n+1} - a_n ≥ 1
  sorry

-- Part 2: Main argument and claim statement
-- Claim: If a_{n+1} - a_n = 1, then a_{n+2} - a_{n+1} ≥ 2
-- In other words, the sequence has to increase by at least 2 at least half of the times

theorem main_claim (x : ℕ → ℝ) (h_pos : ∀ n, x n > 0) :
  let a := fun n => Real.sqrt ((∑ i in Finset.range n, x i) * (∑ i in Finset.range n, (1 / x i)))
  ∀ n, a (n + 1) = a n + 1 → a (n + 2) ≥ a (n + 1) + 2 := by
  intro n h_eq
  -- This would contain the proof of the main claim
  sorry

-- Part 3: Proof of the claim using AM-GM inequality
-- We use the arithmetic mean-geometric mean inequality to show that
-- if a_{n+1} = a_n + 1, then certain conditions must hold

theorem claim_proof_amgm (x : ℕ → ℝ) (h_pos : ∀ n, x n > 0) :
  let a := fun n => Real.sqrt ((∑ i in Finset.range n, x i) * (∑ i in Finset.range n, (1 / x i)))
  ∀ n, a (n + 1) = a n + 1 →
    (1 / x (n + 1)) * (∑ i in Finset.range (n + 1), x i) =
    x (n + 1) * (∑ i in Finset.range (n + 1), (1 / x i)) := by
  intro n h_eq
  -- This would contain the proof using AM-GM inequality
  sorry

-- Part 4: Final contradiction and conclusion
-- We show that if both a_{n+1} = a_n + 1 and a_{n+2} = a_{n+1} + 1 hold,
-- then we get a contradiction: x_{n+1} = x_{n+2}

theorem final_contradiction (x : ℕ → ℝ) (h_pos : ∀ n, x n > 0) (h_distinct : ∀ i j, i ≠ j → x i ≠ x j) :
  let a := fun n => Real.sqrt ((∑ i in Finset.range n, x i) * (∑ i in Finset.range n, (1 / x i)))
  ∀ n, ¬(a (n + 1) = a n + 1 ∧ a (n + 2) = a (n + 1) + 1) := by
  intro n h_both
  -- This would contain the proof leading to contradiction
  sorry

-- Main theorem: a₂₀₂₃ ≥ 3034
theorem main_result (x : ℕ → ℝ) (h_pos : ∀ n, x n > 0) (h_distinct : ∀ i j, i ≠ j → x i ≠ x j) :
  let a := fun n => Real.sqrt ((∑ i in Finset.range n, x i) * (∑ i in Finset.range n, (1 / x i)))
  a 2023 ≥ 3034 := by
  -- This would combine all the parts to prove the main result
  sorry

-- Note: This is example code showing the structure that AutoLEAN would generate.
-- The actual generated code would contain complete proofs, not "sorry" statements.
-- The system would iterate through each part, fixing errors and building up the complete proof.
